# Brief Explanation

I need to build a form to send to potential new recruits for a in store promoter position.  I need to get a sense of their personality and if they’re fit for a sales role.  Importantly there shouldn’t be too many questions but the questions should be appropriate to get determine this information.  Once submitted, I want an AI that will analyse their answers and summarise a conclusion of whether they are self motivated, correct personality for a sales role, reliable and dedicated etc.
